% Placeholder for real label imports.
% This file previously contained label definitions imported from older builds.
% Currently left intentionally minimal â€” real label definitions are inline in the
% main manuscript. Kept to preserve compatibility with older build scripts.

% If you have a canonical `import_real_labels.tex`, replace this file's contents
% with it. Otherwise, it's safe to leave this placeholder in place.
